Rework

make it so that pokemon initialize with an array of stats or ivs
	regardless of this, everything else should still work
add stat -> iv calculation
	formula on serebii website
figure out natures
	find out if dicts can map nature:statRaisingFunction() 
	e.g. natures = {'Adamant': [atkup(), spatkdown()]}
		or something else, idk
maybe figure out characteristics
	not really important, but nice
	
make a gui with kivy
port to web with flask
anything else
